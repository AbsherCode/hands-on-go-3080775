# Hands On: Go
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `Hands On: Go`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has all of the examples presented in the videos layed out in the `main` branch. As each video is presented, the examples on screen will indicate which folder/file is being worked on so you can follow along.

Folders named `begin` under each topic folder represent the starting point on screen during the videos. Folders named `end` are the complete solutions and examples that you can use to compare with your own solutions or to use as reference.

## Working with Codespaces

We encourage you to make use of GitHub Codespaces to code along with the instructor. Simply clone the repository into your own account and launch Codespaces within that repository. This will allow you to make and commit changes to your own copy of the exercises and examples.
